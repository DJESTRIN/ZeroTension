<h1><b> ZeroTension </b></h1> 
A quick script/project for recording tension via a Raspberry Pi Zero. The Raspberry pi zero is connected to a tension reader and a screen. This script allows users to quickly record tension data across time by clicking a few buttons. Recording data is then saved inside of a sd card via csv file.
